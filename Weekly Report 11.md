WEEKLY REPORT 11

After completing the export functionality last week. We are now set to complete the final set of requirements.
This week we completed the signout functionality, we had already added the login module to the application now we have implemented a logout module where the user can
see his registered email id and logout of the application.

We added one of the nice to have features in our application that is to compute the monthly average of spending. We integrated this feature with the analytics function
and displayed the daily average spending of the user.

Thanks & Regards,
Finease Team
