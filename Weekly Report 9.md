WEEKLY REPORT 9

In week 9 we implemented one of the essential/necessary requirements which were given to us by our mentor. This was to incorporate recurring transactions within
the application. This means transactions that may occur repeatedly over a week or a month should be easily entered in a single click.

With this feature, the user will not have to enter the recurring transactions again and again. For example house rent is something which a user has to pay every month
if the user has added house rent as a recurring transaction for 12 months, then this value will be added and stored for the coming year.

Plan For Next Week: Implement the feature of currency selection

Thanks & Regards,
