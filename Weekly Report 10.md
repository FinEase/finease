WEEKLY REPORT 10

Last week we presented the Advanced Prototype of our application of the application Finease and we are now set to develop the final set of features of the application.
We got the final set of requirements from Mr Theo Langer this week. One of the new features which we added to the application this week is Export Data.

In Export Data functionality the user when clicks on this tab will get the information of all the added entries in the Firebase database in the form of a json file.

In the coming week, we plan to add signout functionality to our application.

Thanks & Regards,
Finease Team
