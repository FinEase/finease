WEEKLY REPORT 7

Our team started the work for week 7 by deciding to implement on of the nice to have features that is to implement a chart analysis for our money control app.
We started to work on the application so that monthly expenses spilt-up could be represented using a pie chart.
This feature will be very useful for the users as they can make an analysis of their spending by just taking a look at the chart.

We implemented the pie chart functionalites by using the AnyChart data visualization library.

What is our plan for the coming weeks:

To implement an help menu within the application such that most of the frequently asked user queries could be answered.

Thanks & Regards,
Finease Team
