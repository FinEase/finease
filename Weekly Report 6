  WEEKLY REPORT 6 
	 
	We completed our basic prototype presentation and in week 6 we started working on the advanced prototype presentation. We aimed to complete the rest of the requirements 
	in the necessary and essential category. 
	 
	First, we made all the changes that were suggested by our professor after the basic prototype presentation. The first change was a UI change where the price of the item 
	added was further enlarged so that the price becomes the centre point of focus in the added item other than category, amount of payment, personal notes etc. For this, we made some 
	minor font and size adjustments. 
	 
	The second change which was suggested to us by the professor was to make sure that a user can only add numeric characters to the amount field. To implement this change 
	we gave some checks after the user entered the amount. 
	 
	What is our plan for the coming weeks: 
	 
	In the coming weeks, we will be working on implementing the analytics function where the user can see these expenses in the form of a pie chart and can have an analysis of where his/her money is being the most. 
	After that, we could like to add the feature of the recurring transaction to our application. 
	 
	Thanks and regards
