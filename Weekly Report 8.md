WEEKLY REPORT 8

In week 7 we finished implementing the pie chart analysis of the user's monthly spending. Now for week 8, we decided to build a help page.
On this page, we plan to add most of the frequently asked queries about the application. We realised that this will be a very important feature 
because users using our application for the first time will have a lot of doubts while navigating through the application.

We developed a separate page for this which when clicked by the user, navigates where the user can see the questions and answers. If the users have more 
queries that they cannot solve using the answers provided, our team decided to provide them with our application email id. So that users can reach out to us
asking their queries.

Plan For the Coming Week: Implementing recurring transaction feature

Thanks & Regards,
Finease Team
