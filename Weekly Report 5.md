WEEKLY REPORT 5

After 5 weeks, now we are ready with our basic prototype application which contains all the essential requirements given to us by the user.
Those features include creating a monthly budget, and adding items into it according to the preference of the user and also keeping track of expenses by adding all the spendings.
The spending list can be added based on three categories like mode of payment, date of spending and category of the spending.
The new feature after week 4 we have added is the filter and view functionality with which user can view and filter out his/her expenses based on different filters.
We took an extra effort to add one of the necessary requirement given by user into our basic prototype, which is showing icons related to the category of spending.

This is all we have done till now.

What is our future plan for the coming weeks:

To assimilate the remaining necessary and good to have features into the application we are trying our level best.
For the next coming week we are planning to show the expenses in a chart to make "analysis of the budget" for the user easy.

We have a basic prototype application to take that to advanced level application we will add the remaining requirements given by the user.

Thanks and regards
